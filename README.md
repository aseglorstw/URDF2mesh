# URDF2mesh
The idea for the project arose to improve the model for predicting the forces 
acting on the robot from the surface of the Earth. The plan involves using a 
more accurate model of the robot, represented as a mesh in the .obj file format.

Thus, this repository contains a script that extracts meshes from a URDF file 
and merges them into a single mesh model.

# URDF 
The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML specification to describe a robot.
